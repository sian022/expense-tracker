# Expense Tracker

## Introduction

The Expense Tracker is a single-page application that allows employees to report expenses easily and view past expenses. The app includes features such as adding new expenses, viewing a table of old expenses with a total, searching expenses by description, and showing total expenses by week for a certain year. An added touch as well is employees can also change the currency for the whole application.
